===== Audit Methodology

In this section, if you have the necessary authorization, all automated provided information sources (feeds) are listed and managed.
The highlighted number (red) shows the number of current results from the latest run of a feed. If a user sets the read confirmation,
the display of new entries (red) is recalculated.

The following feeds are implemented:

- BaFin Newsfeed (Latest news and updates from BaFin)

The read confirmation can be set in various ways. If a user sets the read confirmation, the display for new feeds (red) is recalculated.
Blue text indicates an unread feed, black indicates a read feed. Each reader can mark the entry as read or unread.
Additionally, the user can mark an entry, already marked as "read" by someone else, as "read by me" using the "I have also read it" button.
The read confirmation can be set in the overview or in the detailed dialog.
