*{application}*

* Classic chat interface with:
** Text input
** Voice input
** Document upload as context
* Selection of the desired LLM per request
* Selection of specific agents via drop-down
* RAG Toggle:
** RAG can be switched on/off
** Display of the top 8 embeddings including source links for direct verification
** Restriction to a specific source document (instead of the entire RAG)

**MS Copilot / ChatGPT**

* Chat interfaces are available, but without:
** customer-specific agents
** finely controllable RAG usage with transparent source embeddings
** selection of different LLMs in one interface

==== Use Cases – Form-Based Standard Applications

*{application}*

* Pre-configured use cases as easy-to-use forms, which any employee can fill out without AI expertise
* Form fields populate centrally stored system prompts (fill-in-the-blank with variables)
* Benefits:
** Excellent results without prompting experience
** High standardization of results (everyone uses the same central prompt and achieves consistent quality across teams)
** Simple star rating for use cases for quality control and continuous improvement
* Results can be transferred directly to the free expert chat for further refinement
* Introduction of AI without extensive prompting know-how; quick success even for inexperienced users

*MS Copilot / ChatGPT*

* Users have to formulate prompts themselves
* No unified, institutionalized prompt logic
* Significant knowledge transfer effort required for employees to achieve reproducibly good results
* Result quality and standards vary greatly between individuals

[.highlight]#*Value in one sentence:* {application} significantly lowers the barrier to entry and creates standardized,
reproducible results – regardless of employees’ prompting skills.#
