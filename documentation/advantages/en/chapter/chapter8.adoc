=== Centrally Maintained Use Cases Instead of Internal Development Effort

*{application}*

* Development, maintenance, and optimization of use cases are handled centrally by {author}
* Customers do not need to:
** employ their own developers to implement AI use cases
** build and maintain their own prompt library
** continually react to model updates, changed APIs, or new business requirements
* Scale effect:
** Improvements to use cases benefit all customers
** Professional knowledge is integrated centrally once, instead of separately in each company

*MS Copilot / ChatGPT*

Each department must:
** define use cases professionally
** translate them into prompts/automations themselves
** test themselves
** continuously adapt and optimize
* This leads to:
** significant internal efforts
** dependencies on individual key users
** high variance in result quality
