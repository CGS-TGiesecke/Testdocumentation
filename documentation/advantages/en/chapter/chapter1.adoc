=== Professional Focus: Specialization in Internal Audit

*{application}*

* Developed specifically for Internal Audit – not a generic AI tool.
* Comprehensive catalog of predefined, professionally vetted use cases throughout the entire audit process:
** Risk assessment
** Audit planning
** Audit preparation
** Audit execution
** Report generation
** Action tracking
* Subject matter content provided by {author} | Audit Research Center with over 20 years of audit expertise.
* Use cases can build on each other and progressively structure the audit process (process-oriented “guidance”).

**MS Copilot / ChatGPT**

* Generic tools not tailored for Internal Audit.
* Professional use cases must be:
** designed
** implemented as prompts or automations
** tested
** continuously adapted to new regulations, standards, and best practices by the Internal Audit team itself.
* Higher risk of inconsistent quality and professional gaps.

[.highlight]#*Value in one sentence:* {application} delivers ready-to-use, audit-specific best-practice use cases – rather than requiring 
every audit team to invent and maintain their own AI applications.#
