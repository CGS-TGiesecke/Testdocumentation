==== {application} integrated DMS

This is a PostgreSQL database connection in {application}, where system-defined folders and customer-maintained documents are stored.

The folders are created in the database via script according to the customer’s requirements. Initially, these are visible to all users.
The necessary folder permissions for different roles are managed independently by the customer.
Partial documents (embeddings) are stored in an internal vector store (ChromaDB).

Files are manually uploaded by the customer. Permissions on individual files correspond to those of the parent directories.
All data management and access control are handled on the customer’s side.
