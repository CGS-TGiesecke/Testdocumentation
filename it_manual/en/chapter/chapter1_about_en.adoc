=== General Information about the Application

==== Name and Version of the Application

The application described in this manual is called {application} and is currently available in version {revnumber} as of {revdate}.

==== Overview and Features
{application} is a browser-based web application that is hosted locally at the customer's site.
Operation takes place in Docker containers on a Linux server (either on-premise or in a cloud VM).
The application is used to leverage AI language models (Large Language Models, LLMs), which are connected via an external API, such as Azure OpenAI.

With {application}, users can efficiently analyze documents, make queries, and process data based on AI technologies.

{application} is delivered without its own AI language model(s). Instead, the tool accesses the customer's LLM infrastructure via an API connection. 
In order for {application} to use a language model, a functional connection to a supported LLM must be set up.

==== Optional/Customer-Specific Implementations/Extensions

===== Agents and MCP

AI agents are specialized software components that independently automate complex tasks.
Through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, these agents are given secure and structured access to various databases and subsystems, such as ERP systems. 
They can autonomously perform data queries or analyses, extract and process relevant information, and provide the results in a central, uniform format. 
In this way, AI agents enable automated reports, dynamic analyses, or the control of processes—even across system boundaries, without the need for manual intervention.

Further use cases:

- Reading public feeds and making them automatically available within {application}
- Categorizing incoming emails, including evaluating and prioritizing attachments
