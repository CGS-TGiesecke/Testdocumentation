It includes the following file structure:
- `docker-compose.yaml`
- `.env.example`
- configuration/
-- `config.yaml`
-- init/
--- `init_config.yaml`
--- `authorization_roles.yaml`

Optionally, a `Caddyfile.example` or a preconfigured `Caddyfile` for the reverse proxy configuration may also be included.

The following initial configurations must be performed:

- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
- Configure the authentication method
- (optional) Configure RAG folder

==== Deployment Guide (Step-by-Step)

Deployment of {application} is carried out in the following steps:

1. Prerequisites

- *Docker* is installed.
- The files from the *configuration package* are present in the working directory.
- (optional) A proxy configuration is prepared.

2. Configuration Data

- Collect and enter the required data (SharePoint integration, authentication) into `init_config.yaml` (see "Initial Application Configuration")

3. Login to Docker Hub Repository
  
- Use the provided read-access token: `docker login -u cgsmbh -p [ACCESS_TOKEN]`

4. Start the Application

- Start the application: `docker compose up -d`
- Wait for health check

5. Completion

- Test application accessibility in the browser

==== Update Process

The update process, performed by the customer, is as follows:

Recommendation: Before each update, create complete backups of the configuration and database (`SHARED_FOLDER`).

- Stop the application: `docker compose down`
- Update the configuration if necessary
- Download the new application images from Docker Hub: `docker compose pull`
	-- a Docker Hub login may be required (see above)
- Restart the application: `docker compose up -d`
- Check correct functionality

After the update is complete, inform the user environment and, if necessary, publish a quick guide.
