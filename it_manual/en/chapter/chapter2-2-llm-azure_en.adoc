|===
| User Scenario      | Recommended TPM    | Rationale

| 1–5 users (test)   
| 30,000 – 50,000    
| Sufficient for testing

| 10–25 users        
| 80,000 – 120,000   
| Moderate usage

| 25–50 users        
| 150,000 – 250,000  
| Production environment

| 50+ users          
| 300,000+           
| High load
