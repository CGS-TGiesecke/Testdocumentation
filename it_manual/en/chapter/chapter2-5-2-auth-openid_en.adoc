==== OpenID Connect Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

OpenID authentication with Microsoft Entra ID is recommended for all professional, cloud-based, and enterprise-oriented applications to adequately address security, user convenience, and compliance requirements. The advantage of this authentication method is SSO (Single Sign-On), meaning users can log in to various applications with their corporate credentials (e.g., email/password for Microsoft 365).

The necessary data for connecting {application} with the customer’s OpenID Connect authentication are:

* *Tenant ID:* The organization/tenant ID.
* *Application ID (Client):* The client ID of the application.
* *Secrets:* Access keys (can be time-limited)
* *Redirect URI:* Redirect after successful login to {application}

These must be stored in the `init_config.yaml` file (see "Initial Configuration of the Application").
This information matches the configuration for "SharePoint Integration via Microsoft Entra ID" or "SAML Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID."

If this data is *not* available, the {application} application must first be registered by the customer in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.
