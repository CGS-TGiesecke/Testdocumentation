=== General Requirements

==== Infrastructure (VM or Server)

The solution is deployed on a *Linux-based server* (local VM or cloud VM).
*No special cloud integration is required* – any Linux server with Docker is suitable.

*Important:* A VM is *not strictly required*. The solution can be operated on any Linux server with Docker.

==== Operating System

* *Linux*, e.g., Ubuntu Server LTS (24.04) or comparable distributions
* Tested with Ubuntu; other Linux distributions available upon request

==== Docker Environment

Deployment is performed via *Docker*.

*Required versions:*

* *Docker Engine:* Version `>` 2.x

*Installation:* The customer must install and configure Docker on the server.

==== Shared Directory (SHARED_FOLDER)

A *writable directory* on the server for data exchange between containers and for persistent data (documents, databases, vector store).

*Customer responsibility:* Provision of a directory with sufficient read/write permissions for the Docker containers.
