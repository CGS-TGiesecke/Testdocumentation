==== System Prompts

On this site, text-based instructions or questions are stored and described by the system as prompts.
These prompts are provided to a language model to guide its response or generate specific outputs.
Prompts can consist of a few words, a sentence, or even several paragraphs, depending on how detailed the desired response should be. 
The quality and clarity of the prompt influence how relevant and useful the response is.
