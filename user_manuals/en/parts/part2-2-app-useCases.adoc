==== Navigation Area "Use Cases" 

All activated use cases are displayed here, grouped by area. The assignment of use cases to the areas takes place during setup in the administration.
Use cases are lists of use cases stored and approved in the administration, which only need to be filled with specific content before execution.
These lists facilitate routine requests.

The document formats permitted by the system for use in use cases are: .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, and .txt.

The result of a request can also be saved and is then available as a separate chat.
