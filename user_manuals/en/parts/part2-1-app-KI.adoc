==== Navigation Area "AI Chat"

The page features a classic chat interface with a prompt input window. 
All chat histories are only saved in the browser storage and are no longer available after closing the browser 
(if the "automatic cache clearing" setting is enabled) and re-logging in.
All saved use case histories can be reopened even after closing the browser and logging in again.

Before executing request, you can select whether the internal contents of the (RAG) for example from SharePoint and/or the database should 
also be searched in addition to knowledge discovery.

A drop-down menu allows you to select one of the various agents to be used for the query.

Permissions on folders and included documents are taken into account when searching via the RAG.
When using the RAG, the answer will display the top 8 embeddings for the answer and a link to the respective source.
This allows the answer to be verified in the original source with a single click.

The document formats permitted by the system for use in the AI chat are: .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, and .txt.
