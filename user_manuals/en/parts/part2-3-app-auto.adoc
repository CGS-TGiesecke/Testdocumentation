==== Navigation Area "Automation"

If you have the necessary authorization, all automated external services (AI agents) provided are listed and managed here.
These agents are defined in the administration as use cases that have been approved for automation.
The number highlighted in red shows the total number of current results from the latest run across all categories.
The display of results (in red) is recalculated whenever a user marks a read confirmation in any of the categories.
