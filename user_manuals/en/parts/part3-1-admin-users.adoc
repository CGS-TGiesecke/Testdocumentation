=== Assist Administration

Within Assist Administration, there is the possibility to centrally manage all system-relevant data. Here, users and roles, 
the document storage folders (RAG), interface configurations, system prompts, licenses, and the system-side 
stored use cases can be managed.
Access to these administration functions is granted via a system-defined, pre-configured role.

Subsequent changes to the username are not possible.
In addition, a name, a password must be assigned and a role must be given to the user. The assigned role can be changed at any time.
User name editing or changing ist not possible.If an assigned role is deleted, it is also removed from the associated users.
